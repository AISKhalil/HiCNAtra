# Mappability Tracks

`HiCNAtra` uses the unique mappability tracks for computing thr mappability scores that are used for correcting the Hi-C/3C-seq contact map  [Unique mappability tracks for several species](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/mappability). This includes per-base unique mappability tracks for a large range of read lengths for several key species [Umap and Bismap: quantifying genome and methylome mappability](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/20/e120/5086676) **. Please download and extract the mappability tracks in this folder [globalmap_k101tok101](https://personal.broadinstitute.org/anshul/projects/umap/encodeHg19Male/globalmap_k101tok101.tgz) and [globalmap_k20tok81](https://personal.broadinstitute.org/anshul/projects/umap/encodeHg19Female/globalmap_k20tok81.tgz) .**
