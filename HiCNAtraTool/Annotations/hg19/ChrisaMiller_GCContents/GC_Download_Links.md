# GC Tracks

`HiCNAtra` uses the GC tracks for computing the GC scores that are used for correcting the Hi-C/3C-seq contact maps [GC tracks](https://xfer.genome.wustl.edu/gxfer1/project/cancer-genomics/readDepth/index.html). This includes the GC tracks for a large range of read lengths for human genome [ReadDepth](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016327) **. Please download and extract the GC tracks based on the read length in this folder: [gcWinds.readLength100.hg19](https://xfer.genome.wustl.edu/gxfer1/project/cancer-genomics/readDepth/gcWinds.readLength100.hg19.tar), [gcWinds.readLength200.hg19](https://xfer.genome.wustl.edu/gxfer1/project/cancer-genomics/readDepth/gcWinds.readLength200.hg19.tar), [gcWinds.readLength76.hg19](https://xfer.genome.wustl.edu/gxfer1/project/cancer-genomics/readDepth/gcWinds.readLength76.hg19.tar), [gcWinds.readLength50.hg19](https://xfer.genome.wustl.edu/gxfer1/project/cancer-genomics/readDepth/gcWinds.readLength50.hg19.tar), [gcWinds.readLength36.hg19](https://xfer.genome.wustl.edu/gxfer1/project/cancer-genomics/readDepth/gcWinds.readLength36.hg19.tar), and [gcWinds.readLength27.hg19](https://xfer.genome.wustl.edu/gxfer1/project/cancer-genomics/readDepth/gcWinds.readLength27.hg19.tar). **  

**N.B** use `gunzip *` to extract the chromosome files from `.gz` files in each folder.
