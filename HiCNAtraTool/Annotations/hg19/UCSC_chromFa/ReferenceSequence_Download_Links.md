# Effective length (restriction fragment) Tracks

`HiCNAtra` uses the reference genome sequence (e.g. hg19) for computing the effective lengths that are used for correcting the Hi-C/3C-seq contact map based on the experiment (restriction enzyme).

**. Please download and extract the reference genome sequence in this folder: [hg19 reference genome sequence](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz).**
